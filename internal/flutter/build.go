// Build targets of the Flutter adapter (TS-P7-21, TS-007-041).
//
// The Flutter build pipeline executes the framework build targets — web,
// APK, and iOS — in table order from the release's working directory,
// and reports the outcome of each target through the build contract
// payloads (contracts.BuildResult). The pipeline stops at the first
// failing target and reports that target's failure with its output
// details, mirroring the Laravel build pipeline (TS-P7-14).
//
// The target table is declarative (TS-P7-21 AC-4): each entry carries
// the target name, the flutter command arguments, and the platform
// metadata — the platforms that support the target (ADR-018). The build
// pipeline applies ADR-018 platform-aware execution (TS-007-041):
// target selection (req.Targets), platform filtering (unsupported
// targets are skipped with a warning; strict mode fails them), matching
// the local engine's --target/--strict semantics.
//
// The targets run through the injectable commandRunner: the production
// runFlutter runner executes `flutter build ...` via os/exec, and tests
// inject a fake runner so no Flutter toolchain is required on the test
// host.
//

//     whose name is in the list run, in table order; targets not
//     selected are not executed. When Targets is empty, all targets are
//     considered selected — the pre-TS-007-041 behavior for supported
//     platforms (additive compatibility, 005 §8). Unknown target names
//     select no targets; the result then reports no phases with
//     Success=true — a graceful no-op build (ADR-009 §9.7).
//   - Platform filtering: a selected target whose Platforms do not
//     include the current platform (flutter.Current) is skipped with
//     Skipped=true and a Warning describing the unsupported platform.
//     The skip is graceful — it does not fail the build and does not
//     stop the pipeline.

//     instead of being skipped (Success=false, Error describing strict
//     mode) and stops the pipeline, matching the local engine.
//
// runner is the injectable command runner: when non-nil it replaces the
// production runner of every target (tests inject a fake so no Flutter
// toolchain is required on the test host); when nil each target uses its
// production runner from the table (runFlutter).
